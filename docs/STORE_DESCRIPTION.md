## Detailed Description

**Make Classic HTML Dropdowns Searchable - Find Options Instantly!**

Tired of scrolling through long dropdown lists? Searchable Select automatically transforms classic HTML `<select>` elements on any website into powerful, searchable dropdowns with instant filtering.

**Important:** This extension works with traditional HTML select boxes (the standard `<select>` tag). It does not modify custom-built dropdown components created with divs, JavaScript libraries, or CSS-only solutions.

🌐 **Universal Compatibility**

- No configuration needed

⚙️ **Customizable Settings**

🌍 **Multilingual Support**
Fully translated into 10+ languages:

### 🎯 Perfect For

- **Form Filling**: Quickly find your country, state, or city in long lists
- **E-commerce**: Select product options, sizes, and variants faster
- **Admin Panels**: Navigate through large datasets with ease
- **Web Development**: Test and use dropdown menus efficiently
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard-friendly navigation for all users

### 🚀 How It Works

1. Install the extension
2. Visit any website with standard HTML select dropdowns
3. Click on a `<select>` element - it's now searchable!
4. Start typing to filter options instantly
5. Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select

No configuration needed - it just works! The extension automatically detects and enhances all native HTML `<select>` elements on every page you visit.

**Note:** The extension specifically targets classic HTML select boxes. Custom dropdowns built with JavaScript frameworks (like React Select, Vue Select, etc.) or pure CSS solutions won't be affected, as they already have their own functionality.
